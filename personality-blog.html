      <h3>How to Find a Satisfying Career as an ENFP Personality Type</h3>
      <p>Your unique personality type is suited to particular kinds of roles in the workplace. ENFPs people with preferences for Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling and Perceiving  seek work that uses their creativity to express themselves while benefiting others. As it is so easy to fall in love with the idea of many careers, ENFP’s can need a little help to narrow down the options as to which careers or jobs to try. Knowing what an ENFP needs in a job and which careers meet those requirements can really help!</p>
      
        <strong>WHAT SHOULD AN ENFP LOOK FOR IN A JOB?</strong> 
        <p>ENFPs are people-centered creators. Energetic, warm and passionate, they love to help people explore their creative potential. When looking for a career that fits your ENFP personality, consider roles where you can:

        <li>Get to understand people</li>
        <li>Provide acceptance and support</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    <strong>WHAT SATISFIES ENFPS AT WORK?</strong>

          <li>Lets you create new solutions to problems that will help people</li>

          <li>Does not involve dealing with excessive details or routine tasks</li>
          <li>Rewards your enthusiasm, energy and creativity</li>
        </ol>
