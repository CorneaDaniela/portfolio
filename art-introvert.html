            <strong>AN INTROVERT'S GUIDE TO TALKING TO INTROVERTS</strong>
            <p>Is there an Introvert in your life? And do you need them to stick around and listen to you? Introverts can be quite specific about how they approach people and conversation. If you are an Introvert yourself, you already know this and your fellow Introverts hear you loud and clear.
              <br>
              But you Extraverts out there? Your natural communication style may not mesh so well with an Introverts style, and you will need to make some adjustments if you want your Introvert to tune in, engage, and stick around for the conversation. Without further ado, this is how to talk to an Introvert so they will actually listen to you.
            </p>
            <strong>LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION</strong>
            <p>Where you talk to your Introvert matters. Introverts are observers, constantly taking in their surroundings. You do not want to have a meaningful conversation at a theme park or during a basketball match because if there is too much stimulation going on. They will get distracted. So, you want to cut out the competition. Offer to meet your Introvert in a distraction-free zone, like a quiet corner in the coffeehouse or the front porch swing. Think small, intimate, and safe. Think bubble. Location can be leveraged to your advantage when you really need to be heard.</p>
            <strong>PARTY OF ONE</strong>
            <p>Your distraction-free zone could include people, especially those who know you or your Introvert. But the smaller the group, the easier it is for you to be heard—and the perfect number is one. When any larger group gathers, smaller groups and couples will naturally fall into side conversations, but Introverts struggle to pull it off with anything resembling grace.

              Introverts cannot tune out the larger group and if they try, they will end up vigorously defending the position and appear to be monopolizing their partner. It is awkward. It feels like we have to choose between appearing aggressive or passive, and we are neither.</p>
            <strong>NO SUDDEN MOVES </strong>
            <p>Now that you have increased your odds of being heard by your Introvert, there are first steps. Unless you know each other well, give the Introvert time and space to orient themselves to you. You are not there to recharge your Extravert batteries, so do not try to pull energy from them by bombarding them with chit-chat. Let your Introvert observe you and get comfortable before you flood them with enthusiastic words. </p>
            <strong>GET TO THE POINT</strong>
            <p>You won t know where your Introvert s current energy levels are at any given point. It is safe to assume that they do. If your Introvert cuts you short or ghosts from the party, it is because they have hit bottom and need to refuel. It it is not personal and it it is not pretty, but it is necessary. Do not be shy about circling back another time to try again. </p>
            <strong>TAKE YOUR TURN</strong>
            <p>The Introvert is making an effort to engage in the conversation. Cutting them off is disrespectful and they will be hesitant to re-engage. You can circumvent this by asking, “Was there more you wanted to say?” Patience is key.</p>
            <strong>FOLLOW UP</strong>
            <p>Basic communication skills include reflecting on what you heard, making a fresh observation on it, or asking a follow up question before moving on to a new topic. Make sure your Introvert knows you heard them and they will be happy to repeat the process with you. Once you have engaged your Introvert, prepare for the words to come a little easier, a little faster, a little freer. If you have caught your Introvert with a fully loaded energy tank, they might be delighted to spend it all on your company.</p>
            <strong>AVOID THE SMALL-TALK TRAP</strong>
            <p>What if you want the Introvert to make the first move? Introverts are not going to chat you up unless you have something they want. To keep the relationship from becoming one-sided, you want an Introvert to be comfortable approaching you out of the blue. For you, it is an ordinary Tuesday. For them, it is a risk into the unknown. They need a genuine reason to speak up. They are avoiding the possibility of being trapped in idle small talk. What do you have in common? Can you offer something of value? A recommendation on the latest movie with that actor they said they loved? A new way to navigate a tricky contract at work? Make sure your Introvert knows you are available if they need something from you. This opens the door for a wider conversation.</p>
            <strong>PUT IT IN WRITING</strong>
            <p>In the name of energy conservation, Introverts can listen better if your communication is reduced to written bullet points, especially if it is emotionally charged. Conversations held via email or text aren’t as personal, but they will get the point across. Whether the topic is the relationship or the stressful project crisis at work, Introverts drain faster when conversations are laced with emotion.</p>
            <p>Once you understand that conversations with an Introvert are all about energy management, it will pave the way for better personal and professional relationships with the Introverts in your life.</p>
