            <p>When you think of a leader, a certain type of person may come to mind. But in reality, leaders come in many different flavors. Some bosses are direct and assertive, focusing on accomplishing goals and achieving big results. Others are emotional intelligence gurus, making sure everyone on the team feels heard and supported. </p>
            <h4>THE SCIENCE OF LEADERSHIP: WHAT MAKES A GOOD LEADER?</h4>
            <p>We have long theorized about what it means to be an effective leader. Leadership theories date back to ancient China and Greece. Chinese philosopher Confucious believed that leaders must be firm and direct, and followers should obey their leader s demands. Plato touted that leaders should consider the needs of their followers and prioritize lawful obedience and justice over strict conformity. </p>
            <p>An essential trait in effective leaders is a growth mindset. Developed by Carol Dweck, a growth mindset is a desire to embrace challenges, accept feedback, persist in the face of setbacks, and commit to lifelong learning and development. In leadership, this means:  
                <ul>
                    <li>Understanding and appreciating the value of all employees   </li>
                    <li>Understanding employees struggles and challenges </li>
                    <li>Learning from failure and mistakes</li>
                    <li>Encouraging learning and growth among team members</li>
                    <li>Being open and sharing important information </li>
                    <li>Accepting feedback focused on learning and growth</li>
                </ul>
                Just as a growth mindset can be developed, great leaders can be developed. Many tools and resources for leadership development are proven to be highly effective, including leadership training and coaching. Studies show that coaching interventions can improve leadership performance by 20-30%.

            <h4>EIGHT LEADERSHIP PERSONALITY TYPES </h4>
            
            <p>
              <strong>THE INFLUENCER</strong>
              <br>
              <p>Empathetic and supportive, the Influencer always sees the good in others. She is a superstar at coaching, developing, and identifying the potential in her team members. That said, she may struggle with making tough decisions and may sometimes fail to think through resource and logistical constraints. </p>
            </p>
          
            <p>
              <strong>THE VISIONARY</strong>
              <br>
              <p>This leader is organized and decisive with an independent and hands-off management style. She is at her best when she is focusing on the long game, challenging the status quo and making tough decisions. Because of her take-charge nature, she might appear cold and distant, making it difficult to bond with others. </p>
           </p>

            <p>
              <strong>THE INNOVATOR </strong>
              <br>
              <p>Adaptable and strategic, the Innovator is an analytical thinker and graceful problem-solver who is always willing to consider new ideas and approaches. On the flip side, she could be better at networking, relationship-building and considering the practical side of things. </p>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>THE MUSE </strong>
              <br>
              <p>With her creativity and positive attitude, this leader loves nothing more than brainstorming for the next great out-of-the-box idea. She is a champion for change and an empathetic, flexible leader, but she may overlook the practical side of things, struggle with deadlines and not be as performance-oriented as others.</p>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>THE CHEERLEADER </strong>
              <br>
              <p>His superpower is her positive attitude. Observant and excellent at reading body language, her number one priority is to make sure everyone is heard and supported. But she may struggle to meet deadlines and is not always focused on future results. </p>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>THE ACTION HERO</strong>
              <br>
              <p>This leader is more interested in throwing someone in the deep end than gently guiding them. She is resourceful, realistic, and does not scare easily, thanks to her depth of knowledge and quick improvisation skills. She may struggle with relationship building or focusing too much on the present at the expense of future goals. </p>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>THE GIVER </strong>
              <br>
              <p>With her empathetic and supportive nature, the Giver encourages her team members to collaborate and achieve common goals. She is honest and reliable, while also being practical and organized. That said, she may allow relational issues at work to get in the way of long-term planning and tough decision-making. </p>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>THE PILLAR OF STRENGTH</strong>
              <br>
              <p>This type of leader has her feet planted firmly on the ground. She is practical, organized, analytical, and never afraid to tell it like it is. However, she may struggle with building close relationships, delegating, or getting too caught in the weeds.</p>
