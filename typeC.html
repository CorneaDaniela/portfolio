        <p class="questionC">What is a C Type Personality?</p>
        <p>C Type Personality Styles, based on DISC Theory by Dr. Marston, are accurate, precise, detail-oriented, and conscientious. They think analytically and systematically, and carefully make decisions with plenty of research and information to back it up. The C DISC style is perfectionistic and has very high standards for both themselves and others. Because they focus on the details and see what many other styles do not, they tend to be good problem solvers and very creative people. </p>
        <p class="questionC">What do the C DISC Styles contribute to a team?</p>
        <p>The C DISC personality brings perspective to groups and tends to be the "anchor of reality" in the team thought. When something is proposed, the C will think through every detail of how it works and the process. They will make realistic estimates and voice any problems they see with the plan or the already existing system. The C is conscientious and even-tempered. They will complete tasks they've committed to and will be very thorough. They take great pride in doing their work accurately and are excellent analysts, researchers, or information testers. </p>
        <p class="questionC">What are the possible weaknesses of the C DISC Styles?</p>
        <p>The C Personality Type is one of the passive styles, which results in avoiding conflict. They will avoid conflict rather than argue, and it isn't easy to get them to verbalize their feelings. They need clear-cut boundaries to feel comfortable at work, in relationships, or to take action. Sometimes the C can be bound by procedures and methods and find it difficult to stray from order. Sometimes they can get too bogged down in the small details, making it difficult to see the next steps or big picture. </p>
        <p class="questionC">What motivates the C DISC Styles?</p>
        <p>The C is motivated by information and logic. They have very high-quality standards and are inspired by being well informed, researching before deciding, having clear parameters and instructions, doing work accurately and correctly, and seeing a project through to the end. </p>
        <p class="questionC">What does the high C Personality Style desire?</p>
        <p>C Personality Types desire independence and autonomy, but also a controlled and organized work environment. They require reassurance that they are doing what is expected and prefer accurate job descriptions, expectations, and goals to be laid out. They desire that things do not change, but if a change is necessary, it's well thought out and planned. The C does desire reassurance from others and fears being criticized. </p>
        <p class="questionC">What should one remember to do when working with C Personality Types?</p>
        <p>When working with a C Personality Style, it's best to be prepared when possible. Do your research and prepare your case in advance. Pay attention to the details because this is what the C focuses on. When you can support a statement or idea with accurate data or examples, that is helpful. Submit a job description or specs for the project to give them parameters and details, and talk about how different tasks fit into the big picture plan. Be systematic and logical in your thinking and planning, and specific when agreeing or disagreeing. When disagreeing, work with facts instead of people examples. Be patient, persistent and diplomatic, and remember that they fear criticism. </p>
        <p class="questionC">What positive characteristics does the C DISC Type possess when in teams?</p>
        <p>C styles are instinctive organizers who can both create and maintain systems. They strive for consistency, logic, and accuracy and do excellent work. They ask important questions and talk about problems that could hold up projects. They are "do it yourself" managers who center on tasks and will see something through until it's finished. They emphasize quality, think logically, and strive for a diplomatic approach and consensus within groups.  </p>
        <p class="questionC">What are personal growth areas for C Personality Types?</p>
        <p>Although the C style fears criticism from others, especially for their work, they tend to be over-critical of others resulting from their attention to such detail. When doing this, it's easier to find all the faults. It's vital to concentrate on doing the right things and not just doing things right. When working in teams, the C style needs to be open to others' ideas and methods and move quickly to accomplish team goals. The C is seen as introverted and may need to concentrate more on people to build strong relationships, as they tend to be more task-driven and want to work alone. At times, the C will need to push themselves to be decisive and take risks, even if all the research isn't there to support it. </p>
