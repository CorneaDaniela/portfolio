            <p class="questionS">What is an S Type Personality? </p>
            <p>The S Personality Type in the DISC model, developed by Dr. William Marston, is known for being steady, stable, and predictable. They are even-tempered, friendly, sympathetic with others, and very generous with loved ones. The S is understanding and listens well. Preferring close, personal relationships, the S is very opened with loved ones but can also be possessive at times and hold them close. </p>
            <p class="questionS">What does the S Personality Style contribute to a team?</p>
            <p>The S style is reliant and dependable. They are patient, good listeners who want to work with teams harmoniously. They strive for consensus and will try hard to reconcile conflicts as they arise. They are compliant towards authority and a loyal team player. The S is also good at multi-tasking and seeing tasks through until completion.</p>
            <p class="questionS">What are the possible weaknesses of the S Style?</p>
            <p>The S is described as stable, reliable, and predictable. They like to get into a routine with what feels secure and stick with it, resulting in opposition towards change. They adjust best when given a long enough period to adapt to change and require an explanation of why the change is occurring. Because the S style is passive and avoids conflict, they may also hold grudges when they experience frustrations and resentments instead of facing the issue head-on. They strive for positive environments and relationships and can be especially sensitive when it comes to criticism. They want to please others and may have difficulty saying "No" or establishing priorities. </p>
            <p class="questionS">What motivates the S Personality Style?</p>
            <p>The S Personality is motivated by safety and security. They want to avoid conflict and exist in peaceful environments and around groups that are in harmony. They genuinely appreciate recognition for their loyalty and dependability. </p>
            <p class="questionS">What does the high S Personality Style desire?</p>
            <p>S DISC Types desire sincere appreciation for their acts of kindness and security in both situations and environments. They enjoy repetition and patterns, as well as time to adjust to change if it must occur. </p>
            <p class="questionS">What should one remember to do when working with S Personality Types?</p>
            <p>When working with S Types, try to be personable and build rapport. The sooner they feel comfortable with you, the sooner they will open up to you, especially if they see genuine interest in them as a person. They may need help getting started with new projects. Allow them time to process and ask questions. Provide them with specifics and clarifications for tasks they are asked to do and explain the "how" questions. When giving feedback to the S Style DISC Profile, do so in private with thoughtfully explain feedback with empathy, patience, and understanding. If instituting change in the workplace, be patient with them, explain your reasoning, and give them time to adjust. It will make them uncomfortable at first </p>
            <p class="questionS">What positive characteristics does the S Type possess when in teams?</p>
            <p>They are naturally relational, creating a supportive and positive team environment. S types tend to be very grounded in reality and common sense and may see a more straightforward or practical way to accomplish a goal. They are talented multi-taskers but will work at a slow and steady pace until something is complete. S types are peacemakers and nurturers in groups, approaching other team members with patience, attention, loyalty, and an even-temper. They can even view a project from both the overall big picture view and the smaller steps to get there. </p>
            <p class="questionS">What are personal growth areas for S Personality Types?</p>
            <p>The S Personality Style may truly struggle with change, and therefore will struggle with adjustment and need to work on openness and flexibility in this area. Because they desire positive personal relationships and avoid conflict, S types may be overly agreeable or put others' needs before their own. They may need to adapt their communication style and be more direct in their interactions and be aware of their wants and needs. It may take intentionality to express their thoughts, opinions, and feelings in situations, although they make excellent listeners to others. Sometimes the slower pace of the S style may need to be increased to accomplish goals on time.  </p>
